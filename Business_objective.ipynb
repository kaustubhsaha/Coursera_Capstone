    "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario. With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. Every year around 350,000 new immigrants come to Canada and majority of them settle in Toronto. Coffee is Canadaâ€™s most consumed beverage amongst adults and the coffee shop/cafe industry is estimate dto employ 160,000+ people in Canada - a huge fraction of them in Toronto. \n",

    "This Project aims to create an analysis of features to perform a comparative analysis between neighborhoods and this be able to pick the right one for opening a new coffee shop. Typical consumers at most coffee shops aren't very selective about the shop and as a result having too many coffee shops in a single neighborhood results in low profits for every shop. The aim of the project is to cluster neighborhoods based on similarity in terms of amenities and find clusters with low density of coffee shops"
